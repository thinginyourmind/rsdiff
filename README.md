# RSDIFF

A library for numerical differentiation implementing finite differences and common uses (jacobian, gradient, etc). 
Under active development, no stability is guaranteed. 
Depends on nalgebra 0.33+, not yet optimized for small matrices or parallel processing.

Features:
- finite difference differentiation
- partial derivatives
- gradient

To do list:
- jacobian matrix
- hessian matrix
- documentation
- differentiation on grid
- optimization
